    "### Q1. Is an assignment operator like += only for show? Is it possible that it would lead to faster results at the runtime ?\n",
    "**Ans:** **`A=A+1`** evaluates to finding `A`, adding 1 to it. Then storing the value again in variable `A`. This expression makes Python to look for memory holder of a twice. But `A+=1` simply means value of `A` is to incremented by 1. As memory address has to be identified once, `+=` leads to faster operation. "
